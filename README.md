# Sensors Temp Project

This project is designed to display real-time temperature data using GTK and C on Linux systems.

## Description

The Sensors Temp Project utilizes GTK and C programming language to fetch and display temperature data from the system using the `sensors` command. This project is specifically developed for Linux systems and may not work on other platforms.

## Features

- Fetches real-time temperature data using the `sensors` command.
- Displays temperature information in a graphical user interface using GTK.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have GTK installed on your Linux system.
3. Compile the `main.c` file using a C compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to view real-time temperature data.

## Dependencies
